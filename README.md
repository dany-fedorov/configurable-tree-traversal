# Project Status

I think it is 90% ready for 1.0.0 in terms of features, now it's time to go another 90%.
I'll make 1.0.0 when code is covered by unit tests.

Can do depth-first traversals like on this picture.

Check out [src/tools/rewriteObject.ts](src/tools/rewriteObject.ts) and [tests/main.ts](tests/main.ts) to see what
already works.

# TODO

1. Unit tests
2. Freeze data at some point? make trees/vertices immutable?
3. Async traversal
4. Implementation for FS
5. Benchmarks
6. Breadth-first traversal
